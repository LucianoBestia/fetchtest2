# fetchtest2

*Things are changing fast. This is the situation on 2020-01-05.*

I am trying to use the fetch api in Rust Wasm.  
It is such a frequent functionality for frontend applications.  
Rust has now async/await. This is great for interaction with javascript.  
My first experiments with my project "fetchtest" are now obsolete. Forget it.  

## js async + await

Javascript versions have async+await. That looks really good readable code. Finally.

## rust async + await

## build and run

Type and run this in the project folder  
`cargo make dev`
To install cargo-make  
`cargo install --force cargo-make`
